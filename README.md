# Crash Reporter GUI

> This is a Hackweek 2021 Project, we donâ€™t have any intention to make this production quality.

The goal of this project is to experiment with the state of Rust GUI, trying to build a graphical UI to submit
crash reports and gather user feedback.

As this is basically a research project into the Rust GUI landscape, we would like to experiment with following
projects/toolkits:

- https://github.com/linebender/druid
- https://github.com/sixtyfpsui/sixtyfps
- https://github.com/hecrj/iced
- https://github.com/antoyo/relm
- https://github.com/fschutt/azul

Depending on time, we can create a GUI in some or all of these frameworks, to get a feel for what the capabilities are
for each one.

Happy hacking!
