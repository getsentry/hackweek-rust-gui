# Crash Reporter GUI

> This is a Hackweek 2021 Project, we donâ€™t have any intention to make this production quality.

The goal of this project is to experiment with the state of Rust GUI, trying to build a graphical UI to submit
crash reports and gather user feedback.

As this is basically a research project into the Rust GUI landscape, we would like to experiment with following
projects/toolkits:

| Toolkit                                            | Demo                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| [druid](https://github.com/linebender/druid)       | [sentry-druid](sentry-druid) |
| [sixtyfps](https://github.com/sixtyfpsui/sixtyfps) | [sentry-sixty](sentry-sixty) |
| [iced](https://github.com/hecrj/iced)              | [sentry-iced](sentry-iced)   |
| [relm](https://github.com/antoyo/relm)             | -                            |
| [azul](https://github.com/fschutt/azul)            | -                            |
| [moxie](https://github.com/anp/moxie)              | -                            |

Depending on time, we can create a GUI in some or all of these frameworks, to get a feel for what the capabilities are
for each one.

Happy hacking!
